    <p id="para-one">Hey there! I’m Derinell Rojas, a self-driven visionary in undergrad who's enthusiastic about combining creativity and logic to produce innovative solutions that are both visually captivating and functionally impactful. I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science at Boston University, complemented by a diverse foundation in sociology, art history, journalism, and marketing/advertising gained through university coursework and external opportunities. These pursuits have equipped me with a well-rounded foundation, enabling me to approach my career with a holistic perspective and create work that is socially impactful, artistically rich, and thoughtfully crafted with a strategic edge.
        <br><br>My career goals include becoming a Software Engineer and advancing to a Senior level. Along this journey, I plan to pursue a Master’s degree in Software Engineering/Development or potentially Digital Forensics. I aspire to become a program curator, creating a community for tech enthusiasts and providing hands-on resources to boost their confidence in self-learning and academic pursuits.

    <p id="para-two">
        In my spare time, I’m deeply committed to volunteer work, particularly for tech-related events, as I’ve seen and experienced firsthand how programs and extracurriculars can pour a wealth of knowledge and experiential growth into people. During my early college years, I proactively sought external resources that provided mentorship, workshops, hands-on projects, and professional development opportunities across various fields. This approach allowed me to explore my interests while acquiring foundational skills and a clear sense of direction.
        <br><br>Overall, I am excited to explore and integrate my diverse interests, optimizing my resources to build a versatile and fulfilling career.
