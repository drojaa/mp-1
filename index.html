        Hey there! I’m Derinell Rojas, an undergrad at Boston University pursuing a BA in Computer Science. I'm passionate about combining creativity and logic to craft visually captivating, impactful solutions. Alongside my studies, I've explored sociology, art history, journalism, and marketing, shaping a well-rounded perspective. My goal is to become a Senior Software Engineer, with plans to pursue a Master’s in Software Engineering or Digital Forensics. I also aspire to curate programs for tech learners, offering hands-on resources to inspire confidence in self-learning.
        In my free time, I volunteer at tech events, where I've experienced firsthand how mentorship and extracurriculars shape growth. Through programs like HubSpot and LinkedIn’s ambassador roles, I’ve led campaigns and mentored students. These experiences have fueled my passion for giving back.
